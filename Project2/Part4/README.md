To start the project, you have to,
1. We need to start the 3-node spark cluster based on HDFS
2. Before storing the data in HDFS, we nee to download the training and testing dataset from the links below and save it into the github respository. 
    - Training: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data
    - Test: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test
4. Edit the test dataset and remove the first line so only the data itself is in the document. 
5. Make sure to push the Q4.sh and Q4.py files are in the same folder as the training and test data.
6. Push the github respository into your bash and HDFS environment. 
7. Run Q4.sh.
